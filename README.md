# PJ Makes Tacos

ðŸŒ® I'm making tacos and putting them on github ðŸŒ®

A new recipe each week, with helpful insights

If you have any ðŸ”¥ taco recipes, then share them on here.

> **Note**: My tacos don't have cheese because I think cheese is gross. If this is an issue, please refer to the section on haters.
