# Week 1 - The Saucy Hen 🐥

## Ingredients

- corn tortillas (always)
- blackened chicken
- raw green peppers
- raw red onion
- lettuce
- chipotle ranch (or something)
- almond slices (unless you forget them...)
- salt-n-pepa (always)

## Takeaways

How does one get perfectly crispy golden tortillas? My first one was mega oily, and the last ones were dry 🏜.

Don't forget the almond slices 😞

I remembered I don't really like ranch that much 🤷‍♂️

I just got the chicken pre-made... it was fine. I always mess up chicken anyway 🍗
