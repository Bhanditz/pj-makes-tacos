# Week 1 - The Creamy Hen

## Ingredients

* corn tortillas (always)
* blackened chicken
* raw green peppers
* raw red onion
* lettuce
* chipotle ranch (or something)
* almond slices (unless you forget them...)
* salt-n-pepa (always)

## Hot Takes

How does one get perfectly crispy golden tortillas? My first one was oily af, and the last ones suffered from a lack of oil.

Don't forget the almond slices. I got them specifically for these frickin tacos.

I remebered I don't really like ranch that much.

I just got the chicken pre-made... it was fine. I always mess up chicken anyway :(
