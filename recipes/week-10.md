# Week 10

## Ingredients

- 🐮 beef (cut an prepared for fajitas)
- 🌳 kimchi
- 😬 raw red onion

## Notes

This was inspired by a Korean-beef taco I had in Baltimore. I wanted to make a simple replica, and this worked out nicely. What's wild is that I didn't have to add any more ingredients. The kimchi and the beef go so well together, and there's so much flavor it's ridiculous. No sauce necessary.
