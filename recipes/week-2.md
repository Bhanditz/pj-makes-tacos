# Week 2

## Recipe

- kielbasa
- mango salsa
- balsamic vinegar

## Notes

I was on vacation this week, so I worked with what I had 🏖

The kielbasa + balsamic vinegar combo was pretty good, although the mango salsa was a bit understated. I wanted a bit of sweetness, ya know? 🍬

The biggest takeaway: if you're grilling, always make some tortillas. You can scoop your scraps in those bad boys 🍽
