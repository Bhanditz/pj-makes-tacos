# Week 3

## Recipe

- steak chunks (or bits? Idk they're small)
- roasted cauliflower
- Some sauce I threw together...
  - mayo
  - ketchup
  - garam masala
  - paprika (for some smokiness 💨)

## Notes

Avoid soggy cauliflower... or soggy anything, really. I wanted a crunch, but a got a plop 💧

That sauce was pretty good, but next time I'd like to put more effort into it... mixing mayo and spices in a pinch is a good tactic though 🤷‍♂️
