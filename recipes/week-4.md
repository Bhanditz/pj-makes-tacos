## Notes

Tacos are always better with friends! I had some (a lot) of help with this recipe. We had two requirements: no meat, and cashews as a topping... we forgot to buy cashews, so we used peanuts instead. We then burned those peanuts by accident.

We got nicer tortillas then I'm used to getting, and it was a big improvement! Don't skimp on your tillas, kids.
