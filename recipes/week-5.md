# Week 5

## Recipe

- 🐮 beef tips
- 🤢 brussel sprouts! (on the side or in the tacos)
- 🥘 mushroom sauce
  - 📝 We just used [this recipe](https://cafedelites.com/pan-seared-garlic-butter-steak-mushroom-cream-sauce/) and it was 👌
  - 🍄 grab your favorite shroom (we used shiitake)
  - 🍼 some heavy cream
  - 🦋 so... much... butter
  - 🌳 thyme, oregano, whatever spices up your life

## Notes

Not a lot of ingredients, but damn this was tasty. Definitely didn't make enough sauce. Also, we intended to eat the brussel sprouts on the side, but we just put those little bubs in the tacos. It was pretty much a steak dinner in a taco.

Also, I was in Boston visiting Jess for this one, so it was extra special!
