# Week 6

## Recipe

- 🐔 grilled chicken
- 🥑 sliced avocado
- 💃 [Mango Salsa](https://www.kitchenstories.com/en/recipes/shredded-chicken-salad-with-mango-dressing)
  - 🍊 mango
  - 🍃 various greens
  - 🇬🇷 yogurt
  - 👹 onion
  - 🌈 anything else... dream big, friend

## Notes

It was pretty good, but there was a lot going on... probably one too many flavors.

Also, the greens + salsa combo does not keep very well. Keep them separate, unless you want a tupperware of soggy mango lettuce.
