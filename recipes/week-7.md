## Notes

Once again, always make your tacos with friends. Friendship is the most important ingredient in any taco.

And a good sauce. The two are not mutually exclusive.

This one is really simple, and it's friendly for the herbivores, and for pooping 💩. Add some salsa and/or guac, and you'll have a tasty little tortilly.
