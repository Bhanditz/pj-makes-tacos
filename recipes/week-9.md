## Notes

This one was real good, friends. Sausage is not very traditional for tacos, but it's worked out _very_ nicely for me. Between the sausage, the slimy onions, the crispy tortilla, and the smooth guac, this one had a lot of texture.

Also, my favorite thing about tacos is that it's _so hard_ to mess up. While making this, I forgot about my tortillas, so they came out burnt... I was so sad, until I realized that I had some extra guac, and you see where I'm going. Never buying chips again.
